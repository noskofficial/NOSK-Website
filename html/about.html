        <p class="about-content">
            <b>Free Software</b> comes from free software movement started in 1983 by computer scientist <b>Richard M Stallman</b>, when he launched a project called <b>GNU</b> which stands for GNU is Not Unix, to provide a replacement for the <b>UNIX</b> operating system - a replacement that would respect the freedoms of those using it. More precisely, free software means users of a program have the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html#four-freedoms">four essential freedoms</a>.
        </p>
        <p class="about-content">
            <b>Open Source</b> is a term that originally referred to open source software (OSS). Open source software is code that is designed to be publicly accessibleâ€”anyone can see, modify, and distribute the code as they see fit. Also it doesn't just mean access to source code. The distribution terms of open-source software must comply with the <a href="https://opensource.org/osd">given ten criteria</a>.
        </p>
        <p class="about-content">
            The main diffrence between free and open source is that free software is a social movement but the open source is a development pattern.
